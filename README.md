- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jigsy1 - or sometimes Jigsy0 - but this is only if Jigsy is already taken ＊shakes fist＊

- 👀 I’m interested in anime, chess, IRC, Riichi Mahjong, vidya

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Japanese (2021年の7月には5年間になります)

- 📫 I am only reachable via IRC: Jigsy @ irc.libera.chat

- I currently do not know any other programming languages and like scripting in mIRC a lot.

<hr />

I <b>DO NOT USE</b> Discord, Facebook, Instagram, Signal, Slack, Telegram, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc, etc.

- I also hate censorship and value privacy and freedom of artistic expression/speech/thought, etc.
- I also play on Mahjong Soul a lot.
