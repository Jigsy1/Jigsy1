I'm Jigsy ( @Jigsy1 ).

1. I like anime, chess, IRC, Riichi Mahjong and video games.
2. I border somewhere between apathetic and lazy.
3. I'm currently learning Japanese. (7月2021年には5年間になります。)
4. I currently do not know any ~~other~~ programming languages, but I do know mSL and like scripting from time to time.
5. I am only reachable via IRC: Jigsy @ [irc.libera.chat](ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697)
   - I ***DO NOT*** use Discord, Facebook, Instagram, Signal, Slack, Telegram, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc.
      - I do have a Matrix account, but use it once every epoch.

###### Other things...

1. I'm staunchly anti-censorship and value privacy and rights in this increasingly insane world.
2. I play on Mahjong Soul a lot.
3. Sometimes I like to lie on the ground and pretend I'm a carrot.
