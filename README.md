I'm Jigsy ( @Jigsy1 ).

1. I like Anime, Chess, Coffee, IRC, Riichi Mahjong and Video Games.
2. I border somewhere between apathetic and lazy.
3. I'm currently learning Japanese. (7月2021年には5年間になります。)
4. I currently do not know any ~~other~~ programming languages, but I do know mSL and like scripting from time to time.
5. I am only reachable via IRC: Jigsy @ irc.libera.chat
   - I ***AM NOT ON / DO NOT USE*** ... Discord, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Signal, Slack, Teams, Telegram, TikTok, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc.¹
      - I ***DO*** have a Matrix account, but only use it once every epoch. (If ever.)

###### Other things...

1. I'm staunchly anti-censorship and value privacy and rights in this increasingly insane world.
2. I play on Mahjong Soul a lot.
3. Sometimes I like to lie on the ground and pretend I'm a carrot.
