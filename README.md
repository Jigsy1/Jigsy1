I'm Jigsy ( @Jigsy1 ).

1. I like Anime, Chess, Coffee, IRC, Riichi Mahjong and Video Games.
   - Sleeping also counts, right? Right?
   - I've recently taken to generating AI artwork.
2. I border somewhere between apathetic and lazy.
3. I'm currently learning Japanese. (7月2024年には8年間になります。)
4. I currently do not know any ~~other~~ programming languages, but I do know mSL (mIRC Scripting Language) and like scripting from time to time.
   - I do know some (simple) VB6 from my college years. (2003->2007)
      - I am ~~now~~ still learning C and Python. (2023->?)
5. I am only reachable via IRC: Jigsy @ irc.libera.chat
   - I ***AM NOT ON / DO NOT USE / WILL NOT USE*** ... Discord, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Signal, Slack, Teams, Telegram, TikTok, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc.<sup>1</sup>
      - I ***DO*** have a Matrix account, but only use it once every epoch. (If ever.)
      - I ***DO*** have an "account" in Session Instant Messenger as well.<sup>2</sup>

###### Other things...

1. I'm staunchly anti-censorship and value privacy and rights in this increasingly insane world.
2. I play on <a href="https://mahjongsoul.game.yo-star.com/" target="_blank" title="Mahjong Soul">Mahjong Soul</a> a lot.
   - I've recently started learning <a href="https://lishogi.org/" target="_blank" title="Lishogi">Shogi</a> too.
3. Sometimes I like to lie on the ground and pretend I'm a carrot.
